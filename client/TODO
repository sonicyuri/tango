triage:
	- swipe is in the wrong direction
	- accidental swiping too easy
	- breadcrumbs and pagination overlap
	- editing an image, going to the next image, and going back, you get the old image
	- editing an image, adding a tag, the list of tags doesnt update
	- W and D for arrow keys
	- should be able to right click -> open new tab the tag chips

high priority:
	- show tag frequency in autocomplete, on tag chip
	- highlight tag categories
		- fix autocomplete with tag categories
	- favorites functionality

medium priority:
	- like/dislike feature for posts. an "algorithm" in teh future but at least the ability to have a likes and dislikes list
		- favorites options
	- ability to add tag descriptions
	- tags page
	- combine http basic auth with shimmie account auth. move to oauth so we don't have to store usernames and passwords.

low priority:
	- infinite scrolling, make cursor not so page-based
	- better api for the shimmie database - perhaps bypassing shimmie itself (i.e. going off of the mysql)
		- tango should just implement a new API over the top of the shimmie database
		- slowly move to postgres & a new database
		- remove shimmie entirely
	- mark parts of the models as volatile, requiring often reload, and mark parts that can be stored in local storage instead of looked up every time
